# iOS Persistence and Core Data

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for Udacity's iOS Persistence and Core Data course.

## Overview

iOS Persistence and Core Data teach common persistence techniques using Apple's frameworks for storing data locally on the device. The course includes:

* PickYourPitch, which has a small user preference we'll store in UserDefaults
* SandboxPlayground, which we'll use to explore saving and reading files using FileManager
* Mooskine, a note-taking app which we'll convert to Core Data

## Setup

Generally speaking, most projects can run without any additional setup. However, consult the iOS Persistence and Core Data course for more information.
